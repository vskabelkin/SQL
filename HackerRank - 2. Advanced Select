-- Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
-- Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
-- Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
-- Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
-- Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

-- Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format: 
-- There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
-- where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
